# EQ-to-EQE-Converter

The eq repo built into EQE is outdated. Using the [new eq repo](https://github.com/iwalton3/AutoEq/tree/master) and this program you can eq your iPhone easily.

command: EqToLUA < 'input.txt' > 'output.lua'  

* There is a bat file included in the release section, which allows drag and drop to run the program.
* Output lua file -> iPhone location: '/var/tweak/com.r333d.eqe/db/presets/'
    
* WARNING: The arrows are not for show, they must be included to run the program.
